<!-- Please make the title simple in terms of describing the highest level view, include incident in title -->
<!-- of what the pull request is trying to implement, for instance "Account Creation & Login Screen Incident" -->

### Incident:
<!-- Describe the problem in detail, what exactly is going on? What are the -->
<!-- consequences or not taking action on resolving the incident? -->

<!-- Ex: 
Issue with Issue Templates not having apt descriptions or good guiding points to make them actually 
reliably and a feature I'd want to use on Github. This will lead to any issues not being documented and
make the history of the project less trackable and traceable.
-->
### Proposed Solution(s):
<!-- Solution/solutions on how to resolve the incident, this can later be brought -->
<!-- up in a standup to resolve completely. -->

<!-- Ex: 
- Update the Issue Templates with proper, helpful descriptors and not just a bunch of comments
  to make the entire process more efficient and organized.
- Let a person who makes a Issue eat ice cream
-->
### Affected User Stories:
<!-- List any stories that might've been affected by this issue negatively -->

<!-- Ex: 
- **Customizable User Story #13**: Makes me less motivated to use the Issue Template
- **Customizable User Story #15**: Makes me not want to make the ReadMe file :(
-->
