Spotify Wrapped is an Android application that utilizes the features of the Spotify Developer API to generate custom Spotify Wraps for the user. 

A Spotify Wrap includes the user's most listened to tracks, favorite artists, favorite genres, and recommendations for other tracks and artists the user may listen to on Spotify.

The user can also play previews of their favorite tracks or track recommendations from within the app, or choose to open the track on Spotify.

If the user were to login on Halloween or Christmas, they can generate specially themed Spotify Wraps that will give holiday themed recommendations for tracks on Spotify to listen to.

## Development
In our project, we adopted the **SCRUM** methodology & adhered to the SOLID principles of software design to ensure a flexible, collaborative approach to development. We organized our work into sprints, each lasting two weeks, which allowed us to focus on delivering specific features iteratively and incrementally. At the end of each sprint, we held a review and retrospective meeting. These were crucial for discussing what went well, what didn’t, and how we could improve our processes in the next sprint. This feedback loop was invaluable for our team’s continuous improvement. 

Moreover, we used a CI/CD pipeline to automate our builds and deployments, which significantly reduced manual errors and improved our productivity. Each code push to our repository triggered automated builds and tests, ensuring that our main branch always remained stable and deployable. In terms of team communication and collaboration, we used Discord for daily stand-ups and other communications, which kept everyone aligned and fostered a strong team spirit despite some of us working remotely. We managed our tasks and progress using a Trello board, which was an excellent visual aid for tracking the progress of different tasks and ensuring nothing was overlooked. 

Overall, our adoption of Scrum, combined with strategic design decisions and patterns, not only enhanced our project's development process but also contributed to building a robust, user-friendly application.
